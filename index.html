    <h2>Inventions</h2>
    <p>
      John McCarthy was born in September 4, 1927.
       He had many inventions in his lifetime that were pivitol in the computer science field.
      These inventions included artificial intelligence, LISP, and timesharing.

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence - AI</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is the ability for a computer to be able to work on its own.
        This invention was first brought up by John McCarthy in 1955 as an idea for a summer conference to be held in 1956.
        John McCarthy initiated this project that would change the course of our lives forever.
        Artificial intelligence helps all of us in our day-to-day life. 
        This includes personal helpers on our phones such as Siri or Cortana.
        Artificial intelligence can predict what we mean to say when we mispell an adress in a GPS software.

    <h3>LISP - List Processing</h3>
    <p>
      LISP is a computer programming language to code AI.
      This software was first brought to life by John McCarthy in 1958 while working at MIT.
      LISP treats other programs as if it were data so that it can create reactions that make sense.
      John McCarthy's LISP, the self-modifying program, was perfect to develop his AI.

      <img class="imgR2" src="Resources/download.jpg" alt="Time sharing system">
      <h3>Time Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        Time sharing is the ability for multiple users to acess the same computer software at the same time.
        This was first conisdered by John McCarthy in 1959.
        John McCarthy played a game of chess over the course of months with a man in Russia.
        This invention was pivitol to the development of computer software.
        All of the shared editing abilities we know today would not be possible without John McCarthy's brilliant idea.
