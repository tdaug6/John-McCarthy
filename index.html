      <h3>Artificial Intelligence - AI</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is the ability for a computer to be able to work on its own.
        This invention was first brought up by John McCarthy in 1955 as an idea for a summer conference to be held in 1956.
        John McCarthy initiated this project that would change the course of our lives forever.
        Artificial intelligence helps all of us in our day-to-day life. 
        This includes personal helpers on our phones such as Siri or Cortana.
        Artificial intelligence can predict what we mean to say when we mispell an adress in a GPS software.
